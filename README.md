The project was a one week long assingment in which we were supposed to create a small system and practice Context and Session usagege. 
The scope of the project was not correctly set which resultet into people being unable to deliver the asked minimum by the deadline and thus the instructor reduced the requrements. 

Grit Academy Portal is most of the requirements fullfilled before the reduction. Due to the short deadline we attemted to do as many things as possible automatic. 
To be able to run the project the database should be created or imported. We will provide our version of the databse with the next commit. 
The app runs under Java environment, it is a Maven project with installed dependancy for Tomcat, databse, and JSTL. The dependencies are in the .pom file. It was developed using IntelliJ.
Last but not least the project uses file rqueries.csv, which is set up in the DdConnector under models. In the file we use several users whith different privileges, usernames, and passwords. 
Make sure to change the rqueries with your databse port (there is a high possibility that it is 3306), username, and password. You can use only one user taht has SELECT, INSERT and UPDATE privileges. We do not use DELETE.

Screenshots and an updated Wiki might follow as this is the biggest and most complex project we have done so far.
